section "Constraints"

note """Constraints are used to apply runtime restrictions on the allowed values of properties. A property constraint
can only be applied to a single property. It is intended that you will able to apply constraints to multiple properties
but this is not yet implemented. A property constraint is checked when setting a mutable property, in the constructor
of types built with the constructor or in the configurator method of the builder for methods built that way. A violated
constraint will result in a IllegalArgumentException being thrown.

A constraint is a propositional formula with & used to indicate a conjunction | used to indicate a disjunction and ! a
negation. The predicates are used to test a property. Each predicate is a boolean expression. Each predicate expression
of a property constraint has an optional subject modifier, an operator and literal value. The subject of the predicate
is implicitly the property. The subject modifier is currently only used by collection types to allow the predicate to
be applied to its contents. The operator identifies the type of comparison to be applied. The modified subject is one
operand of the operator. The literal value is the other operand.

A constraint's satisfiability is not checked."""
